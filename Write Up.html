    <p style="font-size:18px;font-weight: bold; text-align:justify">Data Analysis:<br>
        The huge dataset having raw data of Australian Open Tournament with multiple missing values was provided. For filtering this data and to make it apt for further processing, Python script was implemented. The dataset consisted of 1387 rows and 37 columns in which about 7 columns and 200 rows had missing values. Some of the major features having missing values included winner, error, serve speeds, breaks and returns. The python script filled the values of the features such as the serve speeds, break, error, winner and returns using the fill forward technique. This technique uses the past player data to predict the current missing value. After applying the technique, most of the fields were filled with some appropriate data, while the remaining were filled using the standard average of all the players who played the tournament. Thus, all the features were cleaned and exported to the new file.
        <br><br>Once the data was cleaned, regression across all the features was performed to find the most important features that contribute to the match win of any player. Interesting conclusions were found by using the winner data. Some of the features contributed positively and exceedingly well towards the final outcome of the match while some negatively impacted the match outcome. Based on this preliminary analysis, detailed patterns were found and data was visualized.
